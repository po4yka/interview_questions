# Workflow and Status Management

## Status Progression
- `draft` → `reviewed` → `ready`
- Always update `updated` timestamp when modifying content
- Mark content as `reviewed` only after human verification
- Use `status: retired` for archived content

## Content Lifecycle
- Create new notes with `status: draft`
- Update status to `reviewed` after quality check
- Mark as `ready` for production use
- Move outdated content to `99-Archive/` with `status: retired`

## Timestamp Management
- Use ISO8601 format: `2025-01-XX`
- Always update `updated` field when modifying content
- Set `created` timestamp when creating new notes
- Maintain accurate timestamps for content tracking

## Maintenance Tasks
- Prefer adding aliases over renaming filenames
- Update incoming links if filename changes are necessary
- Periodically audit and merge near-duplicate tags
- Maintain tag health and consistency across the vault
