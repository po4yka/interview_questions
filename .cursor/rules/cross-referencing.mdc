# Cross-Referencing and Linking Rules

## Required Links
Every Q&A note MUST link to:
- At least one **Concept note** (`c-*`) in the content body
- At least one **MOC** (`moc-*`) in the YAML `moc` field
- Related questions in the YAML `related` field

## Link Syntax
- Use proper Obsidian syntax: `[[note-name]]`
- For concepts: `[[c-binary-tree]]`, `[[c-hash-map]]`
- For questions: `[[q-three-sum--algorithms--medium]]`
- For MOCs: `[[moc-algorithms]]`, `[[moc-android]]`

## Link Maintenance
- Update related links when content changes significantly
- Maintain bidirectional relationships where appropriate
- Use descriptive link text when needed: `[[c-hash-map|hash table concept]]`

## Content Organization
- Files belong to exactly one topic folder
- Use tags for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., `hash-table`, `graphs`)
- Build rich networks of cross-references between related concepts
- Link forward/back for question sequences
