# Bilingual Content Structure Rules

## Language Order (CRITICAL)
- Russian content MUST come first, English second in all notes
- Follow this exact structure:
  1. `# Вопрос (RU)` - Russian question
  2. `# Question (EN)` - English question
  3. `## Ответ (RU)` - Russian answer
  4. `## Answer (EN)` - English answer

## Content Requirements
- Maintain semantic equivalence between Russian and English sections
- Use English for all code, technical terms, and metadata
- Provide natural, fluent Russian translations
- Include Russian comments only when they add significant value

## YAML Frontmatter
- Set `original_language: ru` (Russian is primary)
- Include `language_tags: [ru, en]` for all bilingual notes
- Use English for all tags and technical metadata
