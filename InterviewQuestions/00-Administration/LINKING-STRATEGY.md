---

## Remaining Work

### Priority 1: Content Section Updates (Medium Effort)

Many files have YAML `related` fields but lack "Related Questions" content sections.

**Tasks**:
- Add "## Related Questions" sections to ~600 files
- Populate with links from YAML `related` field
- Organize by category (Prerequisites, Same Level, Advanced)

**Expected Impact**: Improve discoverability, reduce orphan rate to <10%

### Priority 2: MOC Content Enhancement (Low Effort)

MOC files exist but need better content organization:
- `moc-algorithms.md` - Add sections by data structure type
- `moc-android.md` - Add sections by Android component
- `moc-kotlin.md` - Add sections by language feature
- `moc-system-design.md` - Needs to be created
- `moc-backend.md` - Add database vs networking sections
- `moc-cs.md` - Add sections by CS topic
- `moc-tools.md` - Add sections by tool type

**Expected Impact**: Better navigation, improved learning paths

### Priority 3: Topic Cluster Refinement (Optional)

While automated linking created connections, manual topic clusters would improve quality:
- Kotlin Coroutines cluster (15-20 questions)
- Android Compose cluster (30-40 questions)
- Design Patterns cluster (25-30 questions)

**Expected Impact**: Deeper cross-referencing, better knowledge structure

## Original Strategy (Reference)

The sections below document the original three-phase strategy that was planned and partially executed.

---

## Strategic Goals (Original)

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce orphan rate from 82.5% to <10%** - NEARLY ACHIEVED (13.2%)
2. **Balance link distribution** - Each file should have 3-7 incoming links - PARTIAL
3. **Strengthen MOC → Question links** - MOCs should be discovery hubs - PARTIAL
4. **Create topic clusters** - Related questions should interconnect - PARTIAL

### Success Metrics
- ACHIEVED: <15% orphan rate (currently 13.2%)
- ACHIEVED: 100% MOC field coverage
- ACHIEVED: 100% related field coverage
- PARTIAL: Average 4-6 incoming links per file (currently ~3-4)
- PARTIAL: Every MOC links to 20+ questions (YAML done, content partial)
- PARTIAL: 90% of questions appear in at least one topic cluster

---

## Three-Phase Linking Strategy (Original Plan)

### Phase 1: MOC Strengthening (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Make MOC files serve as discovery hubs
**Impact**: Connected 595 orphaned files
**Effort**: Low (automated via Python scripts)

#### What Was Completed:
1. **YAML MOC Fields** - Added to all 942 files
   - 20-Algorithms → moc: moc-algorithms
   - 30-System-Design → moc: moc-system-design
   - 40-Android → moc: moc-android
   - 50-Backend → moc: moc-backend
   - 60-CompSci → moc: moc-cs
   - 70-Kotlin → moc: moc-kotlin
   - 80-Tools → moc: moc-tools

2. **MOC Files Status**:
   - moc-algorithms.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-android.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-kotlin.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-backend.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-cs.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-tools.md - EXISTS (needs content enhancement)
   - moc-system-design.md - NEEDS CREATION

**Result**: 595 files gained MOC links in YAML

---

### Phase 2: Topic Cluster Creation (PARTIAL)

**Goal**: Create interconnected question clusters by topic
**Impact**: Automated related field population completed
**Effort**: Medium (automated YAML, manual content sections pending)

#### What Was Completed:
1. **YAML related Fields** - Added to all 942 files
   - Each file has 2-3 related links
   - Links point to files in same topic folder
   - Format: `related: [file1, file2, file3]`

#### What Remains:
1. **Content Sections** - "Related Questions" sections need to be added to ~600 files
2. **Manual Curation** - Some clusters would benefit from hand-picked relationships
3. **Hub Questions** - Identify and enhance hub questions for major topics

**Clusters to Create** (Original Plan - Still Valid):

**Kotlin Clusters** (70-Kotlin):
1. **Coroutines Fundamentals** (15 questions)
   - Hub: q-kotlin-coroutines-introduction--kotlin--medium
   - Topics: suspend functions, builders, scope, context, dispatchers

2. **Flow & Reactive Streams** (20 questions)
   - Hub: q-kotlin-flow-basics--kotlin--medium
   - Topics: operators, hot/cold, SharedFlow, StateFlow, channels

3. **Delegation & Properties** (10 questions)
   - Hub: q-kotlin-delegation-detailed--kotlin--medium
   - Topics: by keyword, lazy, lateinit, property delegates

**Android Clusters** (40-Android):
1. **Jetpack Compose Basics** (30 questions)
   - Hub: q-jetpack-compose-basics--android--medium
   - Topics: composable functions, state, recomposition, modifiers

2. **Compose Advanced** (25 questions)
   - Hub: q-compose-performance-optimization--android--hard
   - Topics: custom layouts, animations, gestures, effects

3. **Architecture Patterns** (20 questions)
   - Hub: q-clean-architecture-android--android--hard
   - Topics: MVVM, MVI, Repository, UseCase, DI

**CompSci Clusters** (60-CompSci):
1. **Design Patterns** (25 questions)
   - Hub: q-design-patterns-types--design-patterns--medium
   - Topics: Creational, Structural, Behavioral patterns

2. **OOP Fundamentals** (15 questions)
   - Hub: Create new hub or use existing
   - Topics: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation

**Result**: 715 files gained related links in YAML

---

### Phase 3: Automated Cross-Referencing (COMPLETED for YAML)

**Goal**: Intelligently link related questions using metadata
**Impact**: Created comprehensive YAML-based knowledge graph
**Effort**: High (Python scripting completed)

#### What Was Completed:
1. **Similarity-Based Linking** - Automated scripts used to:
   - Match files by same topic and folder
   - Select 2-3 random related files per file
   - Add to YAML `related` field

2. **YAML Updates** - All 942 files now have:
   - `moc` field (single value, no brackets)
   - `related` field (array of 2-3 items, no double brackets)

#### What Remains:
1. **Content Section Population** - Transfer YAML links to "Related Questions" sections
2. **Link Quality Review** - Some random links may need manual refinement
3. **Bidirectional Linking** - Ensure links are reciprocal where appropriate

**Result**: 942 files have complete YAML metadata

## Link Quality Guidelines

### Good Link Characteristics
- **Relevant**: Links to actually related content
- **Balanced**: 3-7 incoming links per file
- **Bidirectional**: Related questions link back
- **Hierarchical**: Easy → Medium → Hard progression
- **Discoverable**: Linked from at least one MOC

### Bad Link Characteristics
- **Tangential**: Barely related content
- **Excessive**: 20+ links in one file
- **Unidirectional**: Dead-end links
- **Circular**: A → B → C → A with no value
- **Orphaned**: File linked from nowhere

### Link Placement Rules

**In Q-files (questions):**
```markdown
## Related Questions

### Prerequisites (Easier)
- [[q-prerequisite-topic-1--topic--easy]]
- [[q-prerequisite-topic-2--topic--easy]]

### Related (Same Level)
- [[q-related-topic-1--topic--medium]]
- [[q-related-topic-2--topic--medium]]

### Advanced (Harder)
- [[q-advanced-topic-1--topic--hard]]
- [[q-advanced-topic-2--topic--hard]]
```

**In MOC files:**
```markdown
## Subtopic Name

### Easy
- [[q-question-1--topic--easy]] - Brief description
- [[q-question-2--topic--easy]] - Brief description

### Medium
- [[q-question-3--topic--medium]] - Brief description

### Hard
- [[q-question-4--topic--hard]] - Brief description
```

**In Concept files:**
```markdown
## See Also

### Related Concepts
- [[c-concept-1]]
- [[c-concept-2]]

### Practical Applications
- [[q-question-demonstrating-concept--topic--difficulty]]
```

---

## Orphan Prioritization

### High Priority Orphans (Link First)
1. **High difficulty + high quality content** - Valuable resources
2. **Frequently used subtopics** - Benefit many learners
3. **Recently created** - New content should be discoverable
4. **High word count** - Comprehensive content deserves visibility

### Medium Priority Orphans
1. **Medium difficulty + standard content**
2. **Common subtopics**
3. **Older but still relevant**

### Low Priority Orphans
1. **Easy questions with short content** - Can be batch linked
2. **Duplicate topics** - May need consolidation
3. **Outdated content** - May need updating first
