## Review Strategy

Due to the large scope (669 questions), the review process will use a hybrid approach:

### Phase 1: Automated Fixes (Batch Processing)
Run scripts to automatically fix:
- Missing frontmatter fields
- Wrong heading levels (# â†’ ##)
- Topic/folder mismatches
- Status field (all â†’ draft)

### Phase 2: Priority Manual Review
Focus on high-value questions first:
1. **Kotlin Coroutines** (~20 questions) - Critical for Sr Android Dev
2. **Kotlin Flow** (~15 questions) - Critical for Sr Android Dev
3. **Jetpack Compose** (~30 questions) - Modern Android UI
4. **Android Architecture** (~25 questions) - MVVM, MVI, Clean
5. **Design Patterns** (~25 questions) - Core CS knowledge

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Review
Systematically review all remaining questions by folder.

## Time Estimates

### Completed
- **Questions reviewed**: 2
- **Time spent**: ~30 minutes
- **Average time/question**: 15 minutes

### Remaining Estimate
- **High-priority questions**: ~115 questions Ã— 15 min = 28.75 hours
- **Medium-priority questions**: ~300 questions Ã— 10 min = 50 hours
- **Low-priority questions**: ~254 questions Ã— 5 min = 21.17 hours
- **Total estimated time**: ~100 hours

### Realistic Timeline
- **At 4 hours/day**: 25 days
- **At 2 hours/day**: 50 days
- **At 1 hour/day**: 100 days

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Complete q-access-modifiers Russian section
   - Review next 5 Kotlin coroutine questions
   - Run automated fixes for frontmatter

2. **This Week**:
   - Review all Kotlin coroutine questions (highest priority)
   - Review all Kotlin Flow questions
   - Fix any critical errors found by automated analysis

3. **This Month**:
   - Complete all Kotlin questions
   - Complete all high-priority Android questions
   - Review all design pattern questions

---

## Quality Metrics

### Target by End of Month
- All Kotlin questions: reviewed
- All Android Compose questions: reviewed
- All Architecture pattern questions: reviewed
- Total: ~150+ questions reviewed

### Quality Standard
Each reviewed question must have:
- âœ… Complete frontmatter
- âœ… Both EN and RU content (full depth)
- âœ… Code examples that compile
- âœ… Senior-level depth
- âœ… Android-specific context
- âœ… Best practices and edge cases
- âœ… Links to related concepts

## Issues Found During Review

### Common Problems
1. **Missing Russian translations** - Very common
2. **Incomplete frontmatter** - ~550 files
3. **Topic field mismatch** - Some files in wrong folders
4. **Shallow answers** - Need expansion for Senior level
5. **No Android context** - Generic answers need Android examples

### Files Needing Reorganization
- Files in 60-CompSci that should be in 70-Kotlin: ~42 files
- Files in 60-CompSci that should be in 40-Android: ~29 files

## Recommendation

Given the scope, I recommend:

1. **User runs automated scripts first** to fix structural issues
2. **I focus on high-priority manual review** (Kotlin coroutines, Flow, Compose)
3. **We track progress weekly** to ensure steady advancement
4. **We aim for 100% review within 1 month** at ~4 hours/day pace

**Last session**: Reviewed 2 questions, updated 1 in progress
**Next session**: Complete access-modifiers, start coroutine questions
