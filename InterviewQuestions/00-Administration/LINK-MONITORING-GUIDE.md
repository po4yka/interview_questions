# Link Monitoring System Guide

**Date Created**: 2025-10-12
**Purpose**: Automated link health monitoring for Obsidian vault

---

## üéØ Overview

Your vault now has a comprehensive automated link monitoring system built with **Dataview** and **DataviewJS**. This system automatically detects broken links, orphan files, missing cross-references, and structural issues.

---

## üìÅ Monitoring Tools

---

### 2. **Homepage.md** (Link Health Monitor Section)
**Location**: Vault root
**Purpose**: Integrated monitoring in your homepage
**Usage**: Part of your daily workflow

**Shows**:
- Broken links detection with top 10 files

## üìä Understanding Health Metrics

### Overall Health Score (0-100%)

**Calculation**:
```
Overall Health = (Link Integrity √ó 50%) +
                (Structure Quality √ó 25%) +
                (Connectivity √ó 25%)
```

**Ranges**:
- üü¢ **90-100%**: Excellent - Vault is in great shape
- üü° **70-89%**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- üî¥ **Below 70%**: Needs Work - Focus on broken links

### Link Integrity

**Measures**: Percentage of valid links vs broken links

**Target**: 95%+

**How to improve**:
- Create missing files
- Fix naming inconsistencies
- Remove or update broken links

### Structure Quality

**Measures**: Percentage of files with proper structure (Related Questions, References, Tags, Subtopics)

**Target**: 90%+

**How to improve**:
- Add "Related Questions" sections
- Include references to documentation
- Add relevant tags and subtopics

### Connectivity

**Measures**: Percentage of files that have incoming links (not orphans)

**Target**: 95%+

**How to improve**:
- Link orphan files from related questions
- Create MOC files that link to categories
- Add cross-references between related topics

---

## üîç What Each Monitor Detects

### 1. Broken Links
**Definition**: Wikilinks `[[target]]` that point to non-existent files

**Example**:
```markdown
## Related Questions
- [[q-kotlin-inline-functions--kotlin--medium]]  ‚ùå File doesn't exist
- [[q-flow-vs-livedata-comparison--kotlin--medium]]  ‚úÖ File exists
```

**Detection**: Checks all `[[...]]` patterns and verifies target exists

**Priority**: High üî¥

---

### 2. Orphan Files
**Definition**: Files that exist but no other file links to them

**Example**:
- `q-some-topic.md` exists
- No other file has `[[q-some-topic]]` in it
- File is isolated/undiscoverable

**Detection**: Builds a graph of all links and finds files with zero incoming links

**Priority**: Medium üü°

**Why it matters**: Users can't discover these files through navigation

---

### 3. Missing Cross-References
**Definition**: Files with overlapping topics that should link to each other but don't

**Example**:
- `q-flow-basics.md` has subtopics: [flow, coroutines, operators]
- `q-flow-operators.md` has subtopics: [flow, operators, transformation]
- They share topics but don't link to each other

**Detection**: Compares subtopics arrays and checks if files reference each other

**Priority**: Medium üü°

**Why it matters**: Improves learning by connecting related concepts

---

### 4. Missing Structure
**Definition**: Files lacking standard sections (Related Questions, References, etc.)

**Example**:
```markdown
## Answer (EN)
[content]

## –û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç (RU)
[content]

<!-- Missing: ## Related Questions -->
<!-- Missing: ## References -->
```

**Detection**: Searches file content for section headers

**Priority**: Low üü¢ (doesn't break functionality but reduces quality)

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Check Health Regularly
- **Daily**: Quick glance at Homepage or LINK-MONITOR
- **Weekly**: Full LINK-HEALTH-DASHBOARD review
- **After bulk changes**: Verify nothing broke

### 2. Fix Issues in Priority Order
```
Priority 1: Broken links ‚Üí Creates immediate user frustration
Priority 2: Cross-references ‚Üí Improves learning
Priority 3: Orphans ‚Üí Improves discoverability
Priority 4: Structure ‚Üí Enhances quality
```

### 3. Track Progress
- Take screenshots of health scores
- Keep a log of improvements
- Celebrate milestones (90%, 95%, 100%!)

### 4. Prevent Issues
**When creating new files**:
- ‚úÖ Add "Related Questions" section with at least 2-3 links
- ‚úÖ Link from at least one existing file
- ‚úÖ Include proper frontmatter (topic, subtopics, tags)
- ‚úÖ Add references to documentation

**When renaming files**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check for incoming links first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Update all references
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Re-run health check after

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Dataview queries not showing"

**Cause**: Dataview plugin not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
2. Enable "Dataview"
3. Ensure "Enable JavaScript Queries" is ON
4. Restart Obsidian

---

### "Health score seems wrong"

**Cause**: Cache issue

**Fix**:
1. Close the monitoring file
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. Reopen the file
4. Dataview will re-scan

---

### "Some broken links aren't detected"

**Cause**: Markdown-style links `[text](link)` aren't fully supported yet

**Current**: Only wikilinks `[[link]]` are detected

**Workaround**: Use wikilinks for internal references

---

## üìà Sample Improvement Workflow

### Week 1: Initial Assessment
1. Open LINK-HEALTH-DASHBOARD.md
2. Take screenshot of health score (e.g., 72%)
3. Note: 45 broken links, 20 orphans, 30 missing structure

### Week 2: Fix High-Priority Issues
1. Create top 5 most-referenced missing files
2. Fix naming inconsistencies
3. Reduced broken links from 45 ‚Üí 30
4. New health score: 78% (+6%)

### Week 3: Add Cross-References
1. Review top 20 cross-reference suggestions
2. Add relevant links to Related Questions sections
3. Connected 15 orphan files
4. New health score: 85% (+7%)

### Week 4: Polish Structure
1. Add Related Questions to 20 files
2. Include references in 15 files
3. New health score: 92% (+7%)

**Result**: 72% ‚Üí 92% in one month! üéâ

## üéì Learning Resources

### Understanding Dataview Queries

**Basic Query** (static):
```dataview
TABLE file.name, topic, difficulty
FROM "40-Android"
WHERE topic = "android"
```

**JavaScript Query** (dynamic):
```dataviewjs
const files = dv.pages('"40-Android"');
for (let file of files) {
    // Custom logic here
}
```

**Resources**:
- [Dataview Documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
- [DataviewJS Reference](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/)
