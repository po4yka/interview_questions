## Next Steps

1. **Import Phase 1 files** (15 HIGH priority files) to fill critical gaps
2. **Review SIMILAR files** to determine if unique examples warrant import
3. **Import Phase 2 files** (8 MEDIUM priority files) to add depth
4. **Consider Phase 3 files** based on remaining gaps after Batch 2 analysis
5. **Proceed to Batch 2** (files 31-51) for complete repository coverage

- Batch 1 covers first 30 files alphabetically
- Existing vault has 27 Kotlin notes with strong focus on coroutines
- Import recommendations prioritize fundamental language features and concepts
- Many advanced coroutine topics already well-covered in vault
- Significant gaps in basic Kotlin features (nullability, collections, generics)
