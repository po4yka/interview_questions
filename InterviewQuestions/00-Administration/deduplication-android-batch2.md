## Conclusion

Batch 2 contains **significant unique value** with 15 truly unique questions (50%) that fill important gaps in the existing vault. The high-priority imports focus on foundational concepts (Context, Fragment, Gradle, AndroidManifest) and critical topics (ANR, background tasks, Paging library) that either lack dedicated coverage or have only scattered mentions.

The similar/duplicate files (50%) demonstrate good existing coverage in the vault, particularly for topics like Jetpack Compose, Services, Handlers/Loopers, and Intents. These can mostly be skipped without loss of value.

**Recommended Action:** Import the 10 HIGH priority files immediately, then review MEDIUM priority files for import with focused improvements to existing content.
