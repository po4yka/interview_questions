# Note Review Prompt

Review the provided note for correctness, completeness, and compliance.

## YAML Validation

Check presence and format:

-   `id`: YYYYMMDD-HHmmss format
-   `title`: Contains "EN / RU" format; QUOTE if contains `:`
-   `aliases`: Array with both languages
-   `topic`: Exactly one value from TAXONOMY.md
-   `subtopics`: 1-3 values, controlled list if Android
-   `question_kind`: coding | theory | system-design | android
-   `difficulty`: easy | medium | hard
-   `original_language`: en | ru
-   `language_tags`: [en], [ru], or [en, ru]
-   `status`: draft | reviewed | ready | retired
-   `moc`: Single value, no brackets
-   `related`: Array with 2+ items, no double brackets
-   `created`: YYYY-MM-DD
-   `updated`: YYYY-MM-DD
-   `tags`: Array, English only

Verify Android-specific requirements if `topic: android`:

-   `subtopics` from Android controlled list in TAXONOMY.md
-   Tags include `android/<subtopic>` for each subtopic
-   `moc: moc-android`

Additionally validate MOC mapping by topic:

-   `moc` matches the note's topic MOC (e.g., `moc-algorithms`, `moc-system-design`, `moc-android`, `moc-kotlin`, `moc-backend`, `moc-cs`, `moc-tools`)

Check forbidden patterns:

-   No brackets in `moc` field
-   No double brackets in `related` field
-   No Russian in `tags`
-   No multiple topics
-   No emoji anywhere
-   No specific dependency versions (avoid version numbers entirely)

## File Organization

Verify:

-   Filename matches pattern: `q-<slug>--<topic>--<difficulty>.md`
-   File location matches `topic` field
-   Folder mapping correct per TAXONOMY.md

## Content Structure

Confirm sections exist (RU-first order):

-   `# Вопрос (RU)`
-   `# Question (EN)`
-   `## Ответ (RU)`
-   `## Answer (EN)`
-   `## Follow-ups`
-   `## References` (omit entirely if there are no references)
-   `## Related Questions`

Verify Related Questions section:

-   Section must not be empty. Prefer 3–8 items organized by difficulty
    (Prerequisites, Related, Advanced). If there are no existing notes to
    link, use descriptive bullets (no wikilinks) and keep the section.
-   Only link existing notes. Questions must be linked with `[[note-name]]`
    format, and links must correspond to notes that exist in the vault.

## Links and Connections

Validate cross-linking and link integrity:

-   At least one Concept link present in the content body: `[[c-*]]` (e.g., `[[c-hash-map]]`)
-   YAML `moc` present, a single value, no brackets, and correct for the topic (see mapping in YAML Validation)
-   YAML `related` contains 2–5 items, no double brackets; items correspond to existing notes
-   "Related Questions" section contains internal links that resolve
-   All internal links in the note resolve to existing files (no broken links)
-   **CRITICAL**: Never reference non-existing notes in Related Questions section
-   **CRITICAL**: Only include links to notes that actually exist in the vault
-   **CRITICAL**: Verify all `[[note-name]]` links correspond to real files before adding
-   If no existing related notes are available, keep `## Related Questions` with
    descriptive bullets (no wikilinks) until such notes exist
-   The referenced MOC includes (or is updated to include) a link back to this note
-   Use Obsidian link health: see `00-Administration/LINK-HEALTH-DASHBOARD.md`

## Technical Accuracy

Verify answer correctness:

-   Algorithm complexity analysis accurate
-   Code examples compile and run
-   Technical terms used correctly
-   Approach solves stated problem
-   Trade-offs identified accurately
-   No factual errors in explanations

Check code quality:

-   Syntax valid for specified language
-   Logic implements described algorithm
-   Edge cases handled or noted
-   Complexity claims match implementation
-   No off-by-one errors
-   Variable names clear
-   Code examples must be concise and essential only
-   Remove verbose function declarations and comments
-   Eliminate redundant examples and explanations
-   Keep only essential code patterns (BAD/GOOD)
-   No full function implementations unless absolutely necessary
-   Focus on key concepts, not complete working code

Validate complexity analysis:

-   Time complexity correct for algorithm
-   Space complexity accounts for all allocations
-   Best/average/worst cases distinguished if relevant
-   Big-O notation accurate

## Bilingual Equivalence

Compare EN and RU content:

-   Questions semantically equivalent
-   Answers cover same points
-   Technical depth matches
-   Code examples identical
-   No information loss in translation
-   No additional content in one language only
-   Both sections must have identical structure and content
-   Russian and English sections must be mirror images
-   No extra sections in one language (e.g., no "Резюме" section)

## Formatting

Check compliance:

-   No emoji in content
-   Code blocks specify language
-   Markdown syntax correct
-   No trailing whitespace
-   Lists formatted consistently
-   Tables valid if present
-   Lists must use exactly one space after the dash: `- Item` (not `-  Item`)
-   No extra blank line between closing YAML `---` and the first heading
-   If there are no references, do not include the `## References` section

## Content Style

Verify compact, factual approach:

-   Concrete and minimal language
-   Laconic phrasing over style
-   No filler, caveats, or repetition
-   No preamble or conclusions
-   No questions back to user
-   Bullets only for enumeration
-   Code snippets only if truly useful
-   Direct statements without hedging
-   Code examples must be concise and essential only
-   Remove verbose function declarations and comments
-   Eliminate redundant examples and explanations
-   Keep only essential code patterns (BAD/GOOD)
-   Both language sections must be identical in structure and content
-   **Add more theory and use code snippets only to directly demonstrate what is described**
-   **Each code example should have corresponding theoretical explanation**
-   **Theory sections should explain the "why" behind implementations**

## Factual Verification

For algorithms:

-   Algorithm name matches implementation
-   Published complexity correct
-   Credited correctly if standard algorithm
-   LeetCode problem number accurate if cited
-   Example inputs produce stated outputs

For system design:

-   Component interactions accurate
-   Scalability claims realistic
-   Technology choices appropriate
-   Trade-offs reflect industry practice
-   No outdated information

For Android:

-   API versions specified if relevant
-   Jetpack component usage correct
-   Lifecycle methods accurate
-   Deprecated APIs flagged
-   Best practices current
-   No specific dependency versions (avoid version numbers entirely)

For Kotlin:

-   Language features exist in stated version
-   Standard library usage correct
-   Coroutine patterns valid
-   Flow operators accurate
-   Syntax matches current spec
