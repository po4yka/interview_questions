**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Source**: Kirchhoff Android Interview Questions - Kotlin folder
**Batch**: Files 31-51 (21 files total)
**Target Vault**: `/Users/npochaev/Documents/InterviewQuestions/70-Kotlin/`

## Summary

- **Total Files Analyzed**: 21
- **Duplicates Found**: 5
- **Unique Files to Import**: 16
- **Duplicate Rate**: 23.8%

## Files 31-51 (Alphabetically Sorted)

### File 31: `What do you know about reified keyword.md`
**Status**: DUPLICATE ✅
**Existing File**: `q-reified-type-parameters--kotlin--medium.md`
**Reason**: Comprehensive coverage of reified keyword already exists with extensive examples, Android use cases, and performance considerations

### File 32: `What do you know about sealed classes and interfaces.md`
**Status**: DUPLICATE ✅
**Existing File**: `q-sealed-classes--kotlin--medium.md`
**Reason**: Sealed classes already covered with UI state management examples, comparison with enums, and sealed interfaces

### File 33: `What do you know about StateFlow and SharedFlow.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Specific coverage of StateFlow and SharedFlow differences, configuration options (replay, onBufferOverflow), subscriptionCount, resetReplayCache. While basic Flow is covered, this focuses on hot flows specifics.

### File 34: `What do you know about type aliases.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Type aliases are mentioned in functional interfaces comparison but don't have standalone comprehensive coverage. Covers use cases, DSL creation, limitations.

### File 35: `What is Coroutine Scope and how is that different from Coroutine Context?.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: While CoroutineContext is covered in `q-coroutine-context-explained--kotlin--medium.md`, the specific comparison between CoroutineScope and CoroutineContext and how they relate is valuable additional content.

### File 36: `What is destructuring declarations.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Destructuring declarations not covered in vault. Covers data classes, function returns, map traversal, componentN functions.

### File 37: `What is the difference between * and Any in generics.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Star projection vs Any in generics - specific advanced generics topic not covered. Explains variance, producer/consumer concepts.

### File 38: `What is the difference between abstract class and interface.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Abstract class vs interface comparison not in vault. Covers state holding, multiple inheritance, constructors, when to use each.

### File 39: `What is the difference between functional interfaces and type aliases.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: While both topics exist separately, the specific comparison and when to choose which is unique valuable content.

### File 40: `What is the difference between lazy and lateinit.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: While `q-kotlin-lateinit--kotlin--medium.md` exists, it doesn't compare with lazy delegation. This comparison is valuable: thread safety, primitive types, val vs var, initialization control.

### File 41: `What is the difference between nested class and inner class.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Nested vs inner classes not covered. Explains outer class access, static equivalents in Java, best practices.

### File 42: `What is the difference between suspending vs. blocking.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Specific comparison of suspending vs blocking with thread utilization examples. Shows how main thread remains available with coroutines vs blocked with threads.

### File 43: `What's a const.md`
**Status**: DUPLICATE ✅
**Existing File**: `q-kotlin-const--kotlin--easy.md`
**Reason**: Already imported from Batch 1, comprehensive coverage exists

### File 44: `What's difference between == and ===.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Structural vs referential equality not covered. Fundamental Kotlin concept: == (equals()) vs === (reference check).

### File 45: `What's difference between launch and async.md`
**Status**: DUPLICATE ✅
**Existing File**: `q-launch-vs-async-vs-runblocking--kotlin--medium.md`
**Reason**: Comprehensive coverage exists including runBlocking, exception handling, and use cases

### File 46: `What's infix function.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Infix functions not covered. Covers requirements, precedence rules, common examples (to, and, or, shl, matches).

### File 47: `What's init block.md`
**Status**: DUPLICATE ✅
**Existing File**: `q-kotlin-init-block--kotlin--easy.md`
**Reason**: Already imported from Batch 1, comprehensive coverage exists

### File 48: `What's inline class.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Inline classes (value classes) not covered. Performance optimization for wrapper types, restrictions, comparison with type aliases.

### File 49: `What's Ranges.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Kotlin ranges not covered. Covers rangeTo, downTo, step, until, iteration over ranges.

### File 50: `What's Sequence.md`
**Status**: UNIQUE - IMPORT ✅
**Reason**: Sequences vs Iterables not fully covered (only mentioned in `q-list-vs-sequence--kotlin--medium.md` which focuses on lists). This covers sequence operations, lazy evaluation, stateful vs stateless operations.

### File 51: `code/Questions.md`
**Status**: SKIP ❌
**Reason**: Contains only 2 code quiz questions (empty data class constructor, lazy property execution). Not substantial enough for import as standalone question. Could be added as examples to existing questions if needed.

## Duplicates Detailed Analysis

### 1. Reified Keyword (File 31)
- **Existing**: Extremely comprehensive with Android-specific examples (Intent extras, ViewModel creation, Room, Koin DI)
- **Source**: Basic explanation with type erasure problem
- **Decision**: Keep existing, it's superior

### 2. Sealed Classes (File 32)
- **Existing**: Covers UI state management, navigation events, validation patterns
- **Source**: Good coverage of when expressions, use cases, location restrictions
- **Decision**: Keep existing, both are good but existing has more Android context

### 3. Const Keyword (File 43)
- **Existing**: Already imported from Batch 1 with bilingual template
- **Source**: Very brief (10 lines)
- **Decision**: Keep existing from Batch 1

### 4. Init Block (File 47)
- **Existing**: Already imported from Batch 1 with comprehensive examples
- **Source**: Very brief (10 lines)
- **Decision**: Keep existing from Batch 1

### 5. Launch vs Async (File 45)
- **Existing**: Comprehensive coverage of all three builders (launch, async, runBlocking)
- **Source**: Good coverage but less detailed
- **Decision**: Keep existing, more complete
