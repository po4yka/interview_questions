## Files Analyzed

### File 91: What's ViewGroup How are they different from Views.md
**Status**: ✅ IMPORT (Complementary)
**Reason**: Vault has "q-what-does-viewgroup-inherit-from" which focuses only on inheritance hierarchy. Kirchhoff file provides comprehensive overview of ViewGroup vs View differences, definitions, and examples. Both questions complement each other well.
**Action**: Import as "q-viewgroup-vs-view-differences--android--easy.md"

### File 92: What's ViewModel.md
**Status**: ✅ IMPORT (Much More Comprehensive)
**Reason**: Vault has "q-viewmodel-pattern--android--easy.md" which is very brief (only mentions MVVM pattern). Kirchhoff file is comprehensive covering: ViewModel definition, lifecycle, benefits, state persistence, code examples, use cases, and best practices.
**Action**: Import as "q-what-is-viewmodel--android--medium.md"

### File 93: What's ViewStub.md
**Status**: ✅ IMPORT (Unique)
**Reason**: No existing questions about ViewStub in vault. This is a unique topic covering lazy view inflation.
**Action**: Import as "q-what-is-viewstub--android--medium.md"

### File 94: What's Widget.md
**Status**: ❌ SKIP (Exact Duplicate)
**Reason**: Vault already has "q-home-screen-widgets--android--medium.md" which is comprehensive and covers the same content: widget categories, lifecycle, creation steps, limitations, RemoteViews, collection widgets, configuration activity, and best practices.
**Action**: Skip - comprehensive version already exists

### File 95: What's WorkManager.md
**Status**: ✅ IMPORT (Complementary)
**Reason**: Vault has "q-workmanager-decision-guide--android--medium.md" which compares WorkManager vs Coroutines vs Services. Kirchhoff file focuses on WorkManager basics: what it is, features, how it works, implementation steps. Both are complementary topics.
**Action**: Import as "q-what-is-workmanager--android--medium.md"
