## Git Workflow Diagrams

### Feature Branch Workflow with Merge
```
main:     A --- B --- C --- D --- M --- F
                       \         /
feature:                E -----

Timeline:
1. Branch from main at C
2. Work on feature (commit E)
3. Main advances (commit D)
4. Merge feature into main (commit M)
5. Continue main development (commit F)
```

### Feature Branch Workflow with Rebase
```
Before rebase:
main:     A --- B --- C --- D
                       \
feature:                E --- F

After rebase:
main:     A --- B --- C --- D
                             \
feature:                      E' --- F'

Timeline:
1. Branch from main at C
2. Work on feature (commits E, F)
3. Main advances (commit D)
4. Rebase feature onto main (creates E', F')
5. Fast-forward merge into main
```

### Interactive Rebase for Cleanup
```
Before interactive rebase:
feature:  A --- B --- C --- D --- E
               WIP   Fix   WIP  Feature

After squashing:
feature:  A --- F
              Combined feature

Commands:
git rebase -i HEAD~4
pick B
squash C
squash D
squash E
```

## Common Git Commands Reference

```

### Undoing Changes
```bash
git restore <file>            # Discard working changes
git restore --staged <file>   # Unstage file
git reset HEAD~1              # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1       # Undo last commit (discard changes)
git revert <commit>           # Create new commit undoing changes
```

### Advanced Operations
```bash
