# Cloud Platforms — Map of Content

## Overview

This MOC covers cloud computing platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), cloud-native architectures, serverless computing, containerization, infrastructure as code, and best practices for building scalable cloud-based systems.

## Notes

This MOC uses flexible Dataview queries that search across all folders for `topic: cloud` notes, since cloud questions may be placed in various folders (30-System-Design/, 50-Backend/, 60-CompSci/) depending on their specific focus.

When creating cloud questions:
- Set `topic: cloud` in YAML frontmatter
- Choose appropriate subtopics (aws, gcp, azure, serverless, containers, etc.)
- Add platform-specific tags (aws, gcp, azure, kubernetes, docker, terraform)
- Link to this MOC with `moc: moc-cloud`
- Cross-reference with moc-system-design and moc-backend where relevant
