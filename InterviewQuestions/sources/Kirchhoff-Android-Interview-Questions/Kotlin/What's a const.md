# Const val

If the value of a read-only property is known at the compile time, mark it as a *compile time constant* using the `const `modifier. Such properties need to fulfil the following requirements:
- Top-level, or member of an `object declaration` or a `companion object`.
- Initialized with a value of type `String` or a primitive type
- No custom getter
