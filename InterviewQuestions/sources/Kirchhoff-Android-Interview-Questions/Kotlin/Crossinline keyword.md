# Crossinline keyword

The `crossinline` marker is used to mark lambdas that mustnâ€™t allow non-local returns, especially when such lambda is passed to another execution context such as a higher order function that is not inlined, a local object or a nested function. In other words, helps us enforce the control flow (return statement) of lambda functions passed as arguments in inline functions. Avoiding non-local control flow.
