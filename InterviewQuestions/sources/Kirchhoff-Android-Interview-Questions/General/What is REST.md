**REST**, or **REpresentational State Transfer**, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.**REST**-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems/applications.

 - A RESTful  application exposes information about itself in the form
   of information about its resources. It also enables the client to
   take actions on those resources, such as create new resources (i.e.
   create a new user) or change existing resources.
 - In web applications its always referred as RESTful APIs as it **REST** compliant.when a developer calls any **REST** API to fetch the resource, the API will return the state of that resource. The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML or HTML format.
