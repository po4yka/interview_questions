# Method signature

Two of the components of a method declaration comprise the method signature - the **method's name** and the **parameter types**. The reason for the emphasis on just the method name and parameter list is because of *overloading*. It's the ability to write methods that have the same name but accept different parameters.

The compiler does not consider return type when differentiating methods, so you cannot declare two methods with the same signature even if they have a different return type.
