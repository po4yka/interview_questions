## Common Patterns in Broken Links

### 1. Naming Inconsistencies
Many broken links reference files with slightly different names:
- `q-flow-basics` vs `q-kotlin-flow-basics`
- `q-stateflow-sharedflow` vs `q-stateflow-sharedflow-differences`
- `q-cold-hot-flow` vs `q-cold-vs-hot-flows`

**Solution**: Standardize naming conventions

### 2. Missing Infrastructure
No MOC (Map of Content) files exist despite being referenced:
- Backend topics need organization
- Tool documentation needs structure
- Algorithm knowledge needs grouping

**Solution**: Create MOC files to organize related content

### 3. Missing Concept Notes
Backend and database topics reference many non-existent concept files (c-*):
- Database design and performance
- SQL queries and views
- Migrations and architecture

**Solution**: Create concept notes as knowledge hubs

### 4. Missing Advanced Topics
Several advanced Kotlin topics are referenced but don't exist:
- Actor patterns and fan-in/fan-out
- Advanced coroutine patterns
- Channel buffering strategies

**Solution**: Create advanced topic files
