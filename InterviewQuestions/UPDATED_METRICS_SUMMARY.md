## 📋 Remaining Work Analysis

### 16 Critical Files (0-10%) Still Need Immediate Attention:

Top 5 most urgent:
1. **q-kotlin-java-type-differences** (109 EN words, 3 RU words - 3%)
2. **q-sealed-vs-enum-classes** (185 EN words, 7 RU words - 4%)
3. **q-custom-view-animation** (335 EN words, 16 RU words - 5%)
4. **q-which-layout-allows-views-to-overlap** (223 EN words, 11 RU words - 5%)
5. **q-channels-vs-flow** (330 EN words, 17 RU words - 5%)

**Estimated effort to complete**: 2-3 hours with focused sub-agents

### 200 Severe Files (10-25%) Need Enhancement:

**Strategy**: Focus on top 50 with highest word deficit
**Estimated effort**: 15-20 hours in batches of 10-15 files

### 163 Moderate Files (25-50%) Need Enhancement:

**Strategy**: Batch process by topic area
**Estimated effort**: 12-15 hours

## 💡 Why the Numbers Look Different

### The "Severe Increase" is Actually Good News:

**Before Enhancement:**
- 51 files at 0-10% (critical)
- 113 files at 10-25% (severe)

**After Enhancement:**
- 16 files at 0-10% (✅ 35 files moved up!)
- 200 files at 10-25% (⬆️ includes those 35 promoted files)

**This means:**
- Files moved FROM critical TO severe = **progress**
- Files that were 3% → now 15% = **5x improvement**
- More files in "severe" because we're lifting them up from "critical"
